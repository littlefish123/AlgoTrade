Capital Assets Pricing Model CAPM.ipynb
=======================================
CAPM describe risk and separating market return versus your portfolio return.

Portfolio Return Rp(t) = Summation of Weight(i) X R(i)(t)

e.g. Entire market = S&P500
Market Cap of S&P500 = W(i) = MarketCap(i) / Summation of MarketCap(j)

CAPM Equation :
Ri(t) = Beta-i * Rm(t) + Alpha-i(t)

 Return of a Stock is equivalent to the "return of market" multiplied by "Beta factor" plus "residual Alpha".
 
 If Beta=1, stock move in line with the market
 If Beta-2, stock move up twice as market
 
 Active Investors believe we can predict Alpha (only more than 50% correct would be fine)
 
 Rp(t) = Beta-p * Rm(t) + Summation of Weight(i) * Alpha(i)(t)
 
 Alpha-i(t) = Summation of Weight(i) * Alpha(i)(t)
